## Overview

ARCADE is an arcade game based on the classic Frogger. Dodge multiple enemies to get to the other side of the road in a JavaScript-based app that allows replays and resets.

## Learning Objectives

## Features

* Replay option
* Multiple enemies
* Auto reset
* Modal popups
* Object-oriented JS
* Constructor functions

## Installation

Download and open index.html with a browser. The objective of the game is to get to the water without colliding with a roach. Use the arrow keys to move the sprite on the game board. If a roach catches up to you, the game resets. In order to win, get to the other side of the road.
